                <p>José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda (June 19, 1861 – December 30, 1896) was a Filipino nationalist, writer, and revolutionary. He is widely considered one of the greatest heroes of the Philippines and was the founder of the Filipino nationalist movement. Rizal's literary works, particularly his novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, sparked the Filipino revolution against Spanish colonial rule.</p>

From an early age, Rizal showed exceptional intellectual ability and a passion for learning. He pursued higher education in Manila, then continued his studies in Europe, where he completed his medical degree.</p>
